mr_utils
========

mr_utils, or magnetic resonance utilities, is a package containing my python
implementations of image reconstruction algorithms.  There's a bit more than
that present in the repo, such as simulations and data loading, that play
supporting roles in implementing and experimenting with the reconstruction
algorithms.

Docs
====

I use Sphinx documentation housed in the `docs` folder.  You can find it on
ReadTheDocs.org -> https://mr-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
