Installation
============

Say you want to use this package in one of your python scripts.  You can
install it using pip like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/mckib2/mr_utils
    cd mr_utils
    pip3 install -e ./

You'll need to manually install the `ismrmrd-python-tools` as it's currently
not available on pypi. You can find it here:
https://github.com/ismrmrd/ismrmrd-python-tools.git
