def percent_ripple(profile):
    '''Calculate percent ripple of the bSSFP spectral profile.

    Parameters
    ==========
    profile : array_like
        The off-resonance profile as a function of theta.

    Returns
    =======
    float
        Measure of ripple level of profile.

    Notes
    =====
    The residual ripple can be predicted by examining the variations in the
    expected signal profile with free-precession angle, theta.

    Implements percent ripple, Equation [11], from [1]_.
